## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Media queries

### What I learned

To make this webpage responsive, I needed a way to make the width of the elements change according to the screen size. This made me learn about **media queries**, which are conditional statemenets that help you to create dynamic rules.

Here's an example of a simple media query:

```css
/* This will apply a background color only to devices with screen width equal
  or larger than 600px. */
@media (min-width: 600px) {
  body { background-color: rgb(36, 36, 36); }
}
```
Besides that, I also learned how to use `svg` images as background for my webpage.

### Continued development

Making a responsive webpage takes a lot of work and I feel that I can still improve a lot on this regard.

### Useful resources

- [Media Queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries) - A useful guide on media queries. It helped me a lot during development.
